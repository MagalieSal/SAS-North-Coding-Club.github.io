      <h2>Rachel Farinas</h2>
      <p>I created the coding division within the Math and Coding Club, which I'm very active in. While I'm currently invested 
      in learning HTML, CSS, and Python, my old passions are writing, reading, and art. I'm majoring in computer science and I love animals! 
      I also love consuming all types of media, mainly political commentary and fictional novels.</p>

    <h2>Alejandro Santana</h2>
    <p> My name is Alejandro Santana and I'm a Biochemistry major. Apart from Science and math, I am particualrly interested in art, its history, and, of course, making it! With these interests in mind, I joined the coding club because I saw it as an incredible opportunity to further my current interests through coding and other projects, as well as, allow me to explore a whole new world!</p>
