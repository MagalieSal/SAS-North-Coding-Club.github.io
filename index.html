      <h2> Alejandro Santana </h2>
      <p> My name is Alejandro Santana and I'm a Biochemistry major. Apart from Science and math, I am particualrly interested in art, its history, and, of course, making it! With these interests in mind, I joined the coding club because I saw it as an incredible opportunity to further my current interests through coding and other projects, as well as, allow me to explore a whole new world!</p>
